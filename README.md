This is a HTML, CSS, JavaScript based project which makes use of a currency convertor API and a flags API to fetch the real time currency updates between any 2 currencies.
The API's I used are listed below: 
Flags API: https://flagsapi.com/${countryCode}/flat/64.png -- put the code of country in place of {countryCode}
Currency Rates: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/fawazahmed0/currency-api@1/latest/currencies
